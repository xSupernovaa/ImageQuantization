# ImageQuantization
The idea of color quantization is to reduce the number of colors in a full resolution digital color image (24 bits per pixel) to a smaller set of representative colors called color palette. Reduction should be performed so that the quantized image differs as little as possible from the original image. the process is done using a Graph approach by using mimimal spanning trees to determine the color palette.
